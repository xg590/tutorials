### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
CORS: The server tells the client in the response that what kind of origin you can come from. 
* For example, server B can allow client access its resource from a webpage provided by server A. 
* The javascript in http://serverA/welcome.html requests a json generated by http://serverB/json.py. 
* Here is a proper response example from json.py.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-Length: 20
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://serverA
Content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{"randomNumber":123}
```
* Without proper header came from json.py, the request will failed due to CORS policy of user's web browser. Here is a problem-causing response. You fails because you don't come from server C 
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-Length: 20
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://serverC
Content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{"randomNumber":123}
```

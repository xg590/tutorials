### Configurate Network
On Ubuntu 20.04, the network is managed by Network Manager ([CLI](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmcli.html)) by default. 
* Show current connection
```
  nmcli connection show
```
* Add a connection
```
  nmcli dev wifi con "SSID" password "PASSWORD" name "ALIAS"
```
### Enable CGI support in Apache
``` 
a2enmod cgid
vim /etc/apache2/conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
```
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/

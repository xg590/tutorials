## Personal Understanding
* Docker supports and isolates the contained software (in a container) with independent filesystem and networking. 
* The internal port of the container could be exposed / published to the external network of host machine, so docker is a good platform to run a server program in the container. 
* Copying the container is effortless so that running a server anywhere is effortless.
## Tutorial
1. [Set up docker](https://github.com/xg590/tutorials/blob/master/docker/setup.md)
   * Install docker in Ubuntu18.04
   * Test installation
   * Get docker-compose
2. [Configure a dockerized software](https://github.com/xg590/tutorials/blob/master/docker/dockerized_nginx.md)
   * Run a nginx webserver
3. [Explore the networking](https://github.com/xg590/tutorials/blob/master/docker/networking.md)
   * Run two separate containers so that we can ping one from the another via internal network.
4. [Orchestration between containers](https://github.com/xg590/tutorials/blob/master/docker/nextcloud.md)
   * Serve Nextcloud with the assitance from Let's Encrypt, MariaDB, and Nginx. 
## Quick Reference
Get a shell ( hold down CTRL and type p followed by q to <b>detach</b> )

``` 
Stop a running container
```
$ docker ps

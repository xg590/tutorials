### LightSail
Lightwight Virtual Private Server (VPS). Cheap and easy to use but weak. Ideal for small web server but failed to be a gaming platform.<br>
All resources (CPU, RAM, SSD) are bundled.<br>
Billing based on the existence of instance and stop billing until the instance is deleted. All other resources are add-ons and incur addtional fees until they are deleted.
### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
Powerful VPS with Myriad of hardware configurations. Good to be a dedicated gaming server. <br>
Billing based on the running of instance and existence of attached Elastic Block Store (EBS). I like this billing policy. Cheap storage fee (0.1USD/GB/m.) and affordable computation resource (0.023USD/hr for 1vCPU/2GBRAM)

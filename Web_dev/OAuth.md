### Concept of OAuth 2.0
* A scheme for a client application to retrive access tokens from a remote OAuth service and gain remote access to many other services with these tokens.
  * The client could be a web app, mobile native app, desktop app.
  * The client shows the credential to the OAuth service to retrive the tokens
  * Other services accept tokens instead of credential.
  * OAuth service could be provided by a single entity (Google or Facebook), tokens might be accepted by other entities (small shopping website, stack exchange, reddit)

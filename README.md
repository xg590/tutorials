### Who I am
* Researcher and technican related to <i>high performance computation</i> (HPC):
  * Utilized HPC to investigate organic reaction mechanism and material property ([Published Papers](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Xiaokang-Guo-2045488309))
  * HPC sysadmin 
    * Sysadmin of clusters for Chemistry Department at Zhengzhou University
    * Worked as a contractor to support old clusters for other departments and to install new clusters for other institutions.
* PhD research:
  * Collected covalent inhibitors and created a database (CovBinderInPDB).
    * CovBinderInPDB is publicly accessible at <a href="https://yzhang.hpc.nyu.edu/CovBinderInPDB/">https://yzhang.hpc.nyu.edu/CovBinderInPDB/</a>
    * X. Guo, Y. Zhang, <i>J. Chem. Inf. Model.</i>, <b>2022</b>, <i>62</i>, 6057â€“6068. [ACS Full Text](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01216)
  * Trained the first machine-learning model for predicting the covalent inhibition.
    * Because only CovBinderInPDB has collected the products of covalent inhibitions
* Programmer:
  * Good at Python/MicroPython
    * Play with everything like machine learning, robotics, backend development.
  * OK with C/C++, SQL, Cypher, Shellscript, Javascript.
    * Do specific job like text mining, data or server management, frontend or VR development.
  * Full-stack Web Dev
    * Front-end : Vue.js
    * Back-end  : Flask
    * Database  : Neo4j and Postgresql
    * Deployment: Amazon/Google Cloud and Docker/Singularity
* Personal automation projects: 
  * [Digital Radio](https://github.com/xg590/SX1276) 
    * A MicroPython library to operate SX1276 (a kilometer-range radio modem)
    * Might be the first library that exploits the <i>Frequency Hoppoing</i> feature of SX1276.
  * [Drone](https://github.com/xg590/Tello-Python)
    * Control my Tello drone and capture the video stream.
  * [Home automation](https://github.com/xg590/Home_Automation) 
    * Automate my ceiling light and air conditioner, DIY a WiFi remote and more. 
  * [pyWebREPL](https://github.com/xg590/pyWebREPL) 
    * A Python library to control microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32) in real time 
  * [Rover](https://github.com/xg590/IoT_Rover) 
    * A rover that is controlled over the internet.
  * [remoteKM](https://github.com/xg590/remoteKM)
    * A gadget that emulates keyboard/mouse and is controlled over the internet to install Operating System for my parents' computer.

### My Way to Learn Unreal Engine
1. Learn GIMP because I need a photo editor to create the texture. 
From this 
to this (I can use it in UV editing). 
2. Learn Blender ([tutorial 1](), [tutorial 2]()) because I need 3D modeling to create static mesh. I can also create material for the static mesh and use UV mapping to wrap texture around the static mesh.
This is UV mapping.
This is the result.
3. Begin with Blueprint scripting ([tutorial 1](), [tutorial 2]())in Unreal Engine.
4. Play with VR headset ([setup tutorial]).
